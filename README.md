# JLL-Industry-Data-API

OpenAI for Industry Standardization is an innovative solution that leverages the power of OpenAI API to generate standardized industry classifications based on existing data within the Databricks platform. This project aims to automate and enhance the industry mapping process, resulting in improved data accuracy and increased efficiency for business intelligence.

This solution is specifically designed to be executed on the Databricks platform, offering several advantages:
1.Seamless integration with other data processing steps: Databricks enables easy integration with various data processing steps, ensuring smooth operations and enhanced efficiency when working with complex data workflows.
2.Sophisticated features: By utilizing Databricks' sophisticated features, we can fully leverage its capabilities to optimize computations, manage computational resources effectively, and align our solution with existing data processing steps.

While the primary application of this solution is industry standardization, the algorithm can be extended to generate other relevant data, such as Forbes 2000 data, as demonstrated in our code. This versatility allows for the extraction of valuable insights from different sources, enhancing the overall functionalities of the solution.
